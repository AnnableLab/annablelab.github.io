This site aims to be a beginner's guide for setting up **EMHASS** with Home Assistant. It specifically targets those with
a Sigenergy system with Amber Electric pricing. In the end you will have home assistant automatically controlling your
battery, optimizing when to charge and discharge to and from the grid based on pricing and weather forecasts. This is
akin to Amber's SmartShift, but you have full control and able to run locally.

## Disclaimer

I do not claim to be an energy expert, and this guide is still a work in progress, but it does provide a complete working
solution. I am just a software engineer sharing my learnings in the hopes of helping others as I found EMHASS quite
thorny to begin with.

Feedback and contributions are welcome. Feel free to raise issues or pull requests over on
[GitHub](https://github.com/AnnableLab/annablelab.github.io).

## Getting started

First, we will start with an overview of the general architecture of how everything fits together.
