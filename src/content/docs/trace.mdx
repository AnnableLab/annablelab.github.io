description: How to download and debug EMHASS script traces to verify sensor data and configuration.
---

import CodeBlock from "../../components/CodeBlock.astro";

The EMHASS script trace is a JSON file that contains all the information sent to EMHASS from Home Assistant. It is great
for debugging as you can verify that all the sensors are working and that the data sent to EMHASS is correct.

1. Open the Generate EMHASS Energy Plan script (note: not the automation)
2. Click the Traces icon up the top right
3. Click the 3 dots up the top right
4. Click Download trace

## Common Issues

### 1. Invalid inverter settings

Under `sequence/5` there should be a payload that should contain all the inverter parameters. e.g.

<CodeBlock
  lang="json"
  code={`"battery_charge_power_max": 25200,
"battery_discharge_power_max": 28800,
"maximum_power_from_grid": 45000,
"maximum_power_to_grid": 30000,
"inverter_ac_output_max": 30000,
"inverter_ac_input_max": 30000,`}
/>

Make sure these all have values and they are in watts.

### 2. Invalid current Load/Price/PV

Check the first value under all these lists of values:

1. `load_cost_forecast`
2. `prod_price_forecast`
3. `load_power_forecast`
4. `pv_power_forecast`

Make sure they look correct and valid.
