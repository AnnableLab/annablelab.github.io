# Automated Battery Control

EMHASS by itself just creates the energy plan, but it won't actually know how to execute upon it. In order to execute
the plan, we will need an automation.

Note: Make sure the Sigenergy integration is no longer in Read-Only Mode, as we will now be changing values
automatically! You will also have to turn `switch.sigen_plant_remote_ems_controled_by_home_assistant` on (Important:
This will disable Amber SmartShift, which as of this writing you cannot currently turn back on without contacting
Amber).

This automation switches the Sigenergy battery system between 4 operating modes depending on the energy plan:

1. Maximum Self Consumption
2. Command Discharging (PV First)
3. Command Charging (PV First)
4. Standby

Using just these four modes and modulating various charge and discharge limits, we can achieve a great deal!

You will also need to manually enable these disabled Sigenergy Plant sensors in order for the script to function:

- `select.sigen_plant_remote_ems_control_mode`
- `number.sigen_plant_ess_max_charging_limit`
- `number.sigen_plant_ess_max_discharging_limit`
- `number.sigen_plant_pcs_import_limitation`
- `number.sigen_plant_grid_export_limitation`
- `number.sigen_plant_pv_max_power_limit`

<CodeBlock lang="yaml" code={batteryAutomationYaml} />

### Curtailment

You will also want an automation to automatically handle negative prices. This automation will prevent selling PV at a
negative feed-in price and will also prevent using solar when there is a negative general price (as you'll make more
money drawing from the grid instead).
