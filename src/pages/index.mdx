# Home Assistant Sigenergy Battery Automation with EMHASS

This is a comprehensive guide to setting up an energy management system with Home Assistant. The goal of this guide is
to automatically control your Sigenergy solar + battery system to either minimize cost, maximize profit or maximize
self-consumption (selling any excess).

The approach used in this guide is designed for the Australian electricity market. However, it can be adjusted for any
market that offers dynamic pricing.

In this guide, we will be using EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant), an energy optimizer that generates an
optimal battery charge/discharge schedule based on forecasts.
